excerpt: Best Steak <br> ★★★
---
The first time I had a steak at Peter Luger's was in 2012. That meal **changed my definition of what a steak could be**. Since then, I've had a lot more steak, but nothing ever reminded me of my experience in Brooklyn. So when I visited the steakhouse again in 2017, I wanted to verify if Peter Luger's really did deserve all the praise I was telling everyone about. Needless to say, the second time around felt exactly like my first time. Only difference was that I didn't feel significantly poorer afterwards.
