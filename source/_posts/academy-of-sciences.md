This place had a couple of cool exhibits. There is the albino alligator, a mini simulated rainforest, a couple planetarium shows (I watched **[Incoming!](https://www.calacademy.org/incoming)**), etc. I should note, I'm personally not that into science museums but it was one of the better one's I've been to. Although I prefer the **[Exploratorium](https://www.exploratorium.edu/)** over it.

### Butterflies

Probably the best part of the museum was the simulated rainforest. You can definitely feel the humidity upon entering. And the best part of the rainforest itself were these guys. I didn't know what butterflies eat before this. Now I at least know they find oranges edible.

### Spider
It's the same spider. Just two different perspectives.

### Turtle

I like turtles. I also like this picture I took of one. Or is it a tortoise? I'm not good with animals.

### Lizard
All I can really say about this picture is that it looks like a lizard. Pretty sure it's a lizard, or at least a type of one. I like the shot I took of it though; seems all mysterious and in the shadows.

### Gecko
I think this is a gecko. What's the difference between a gecko and a lizard? I'm not sure, so I looked it up. Turns out a gecko is a type of lizard. It's also the mascot for Geico. Yeah... I'm still not sure if this is a gecko.

### Stingray

These things are *wide*. It would be quite a scary sight if a lot of them came at you or swam over you. But then again I guess that would be the case for anything.

### Roof

I really like the roof of this place. The _grass-roof-that-has-glass-windows-dome-thing_ is very aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. Plus I believe it has a bunch of environmental benefits; that last statement was really just a guess to be honest with you.

### Golden Gate Park

And to conclude, I'd like to mention that this place is located in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, so there's lots of things to see in the nearby vicinity. For example, here's a picture of the Music Concourse, which is situated between the Academy and the de Young Museum. And right behind that stage is where you can get in on some segway tours. So yeah, take the time to explore the park.
