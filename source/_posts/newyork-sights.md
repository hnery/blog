excerpt: The Big Apple
---
The first time I was here was in 2012. Back then I was a student without a lot of disposable income, but I was interning in Waterloo and I figured it was a good chance to visit the so called Big Apple. I recall that trip to New York made me realize a couple of things:

1. New York is a **true metropolitan city**
2. Vancouver is small
3. Traveling really does give you new perspectives of the world
4. This place is **dirty**, like piles of garbage bags on every street dirty

### Peter Luger Steak House
The best steak I ever had. And had **[again](/peterluger)**. The place was exactly as I remembered it. Pretty sure the doorman was also the same person; the same guy that I tipped. This time around, we actually had reservations and didn't need to catch a flight right after. Also we prepared cash as this place only accepted Peter Luger credit cards.

### Sushi on Jones
Sushi restaurant that only has 6 seats, and they were all **outside**. Luckily it wasn't raining. Unluckily, it was blazing hot that day. Sushi was definitely above average and the experience was unique. Kind of overpriced.

### Joe's Pizza
Never really craved pizza. Also never understood cheese pizza. However I do _get_ **Joe's Pizza**, not sure why. I always saw pizza as a cheap way to feed a bunch of people in some sort of gathering. Probably something to do with my experience in university.

### One World Trade Center
I didn't actually go in. Just saw it from the base of whether the other two buildings use to stand.

### Occulus
Some fancy architecture for a train station that includes some fancy shops. And it's close to One World Trade Center. That was all I gathered as I walked through it to check out the 9/11 Memorial area.

### Gramercy Tavern
Came here for lunch. Seriously don't remember what I ate; I just remember it was pretty good and we were in the "dining room" part of the restaurant. But yeah, it had all the attributes I would expect out of a fine dining restaurant: flawless service, great food, intimate atmosphere, and elegant interior design. The only thing not expected was that they are a non-tipping restaurant. Didn't take picture of food since I always feel awkward doing it at these kind of places.
