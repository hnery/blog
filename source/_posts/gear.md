#### Olympus OM-D EM-10
##### June 2015 - Present
This is my first "real camera". All I knew at the time of purchase was that I wanted something lightweight and portable. I got the kit lens but ended up never really using it.

##### Lenses
- Panosonic 20mm/1.7f ***(most used)***
- Olympus 45mm/1.8f
- Rokinon 12mm/2.0f

#### iPhone 7 Plus
##### October 2016 - Present
I had the choice between an iPhone 7 or this. I chose this. I never really use the _Portrait Mode_ as it's pretty inconvenient to switch to that mode. _Live Photos_ are pretty cool though.
