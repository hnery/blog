:camera:
#### Olympus OM-D EM-10
##### June 2015 - Present
This is my first "real camera". All I knew at the time of purchase was that I wanted something lightweight and portable. I got the kit lens but never ended up using it. Most of my photos are shot with my **20mm/1.7f** on aperture priority; but I do dab into auto/program mode as well since I am a `n00b`. Appreciate any feedback.

##### Lenses
- Panosonic 20mm/1.7f
- Olympus 45mm/1.8f
- Rokinon 12mm/2.0f

#### iPhone 7 Plus

I had the choice between an iPhone 7 or this. I chose this for the camera. However, I never really use the _Portrait Mode_ as it's pretty inconvenient to switch to that mode. _Live Photos_ are pretty cool though.
